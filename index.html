                        <p>Tiffany who also goes by Space who gives me joy and lets me be happy in life. Brought me out of a dark place in my life. I will say that other gave me hope in this world, but she contributed a decent amount to save me from almost going over the point of no return. She was able to gave me joy from just talking to her about my day. I was also able to just her joy from joking around with her online.

                        <p>There was many people to help when i was at my lowest but the most to help me was Tiffany. She is everything to have a best friend and as a girlfriend. With great personality and caring about with everyone around her. She was always there to help a friend in need and she deserves more from this sorry world.  She plays a lot of Osu! and is pretty good at it, I could never win against her. Our group of friend which includes Jay, Jamie, Hunter, Sam, Tiffany, and I play online all the time enjoying each other's company. We complain over small things and joke around with each other. We all hoping those day keep going on. Her drawings are really good, but she only draw when she has nothing else to do. She also watches a bunch of anime and reads a ton of manga. When we are by ourself in a Skype call we are watching anime.</p>

                        <p>Tiffany and I meet from a friend of our name Jay we came together to play video games, Although she doesn't have the best computer to run most games. After a year and a few month of knowing her, I gained the courage of  asking her out. I was afraid to ask he out due to my low self esteem and I think I am really annoying but talking to Tiffany makes me forget all about that. She might joke around and make fun of me because of that but I don't care cause being with her gives me some of the best time. When ever she is feeling down I would try to cheer her up and try to make a fool of myself. just to make her laugh and it would always make my day.</p>

                              <p>The images were images that represent her. The very top one is her that I asked for to use on this project. The two middle on is the one that she drew and I also asked for to use in this project. The bottom two is from online. The one on the left is a slime from the game called "Feel The Snow" and a game that we played together. The one on the right is a edited photo of the game called "Osu!" but it saids owo!.
